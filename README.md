This repository holds the NextPVR wiki, which can be viewed at:
https://github.com/sub3/NextPVR/wiki

**Can I add to the wiki?**  
For those interested in contributing to the wiki, you'll need to create a github account, then PM me on the NextPVR forums (my account name is 'sub') , letting me know your github account name. I'll then add you to the list of collaborators with access to this repository. 

The wiki is written using Markdown. You can find an overview of the Markdown language at https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

**Making changes...**  
For smaller changes, you can simply use the 'edit' or 'new page' buttons on the https://github.com/sub3/NextPVR/wiki page. Remember to click the 'preview changes' button to check your updates before saving them. 

For more complicated changes, you may want to clone a copy of https://github.com/sub3/NextPVR.wiki.git to a local directory, then use a tool like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, with a Markdown extension. This will allow you to visually see the changes as your make them, across multiple pages etc, before commiting the changes and pushing them to the NextPVR.wiki repository.
